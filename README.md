# üéôÔ∏è Murf_ai 

This project is a hands-on guide to building a **voice-based conversational AI** using modern web technologies and powerful AI APIs. You can engage in a **continuous, voice-to-voice conversation** with an AI powered by **Google's Gemini LLM**. The agent remembers the context of your conversation, enabling natural follow-up questions and a more human-like interaction.  

The repository is structured by **day**, with each folder representing a significant step in the development process ‚Äî from setting up the server to implementing a **full conversational loop with memory**.

## ‚ú® Key Features  
- **Voice-to-Voice Interaction**: Speak to the agent and receive a spoken response for a seamless conversational experience.  
- **Contextual Conversations**: Maintains a chat history per session, enabling intelligent follow-ups.  
- **End-to-End AI Pipeline**: Integrates Speech-to-Text ‚Üí LLM ‚Üí Text-to-Speech in one flow.  
- **Modern & Intuitive UI**: Clean, single-button interface with visual feedback (ready, recording, thinking).  
- **Robust Error Handling**: Includes fallback audio responses for smooth user experience when API calls fail.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture  

The application follows a **client-server architecture**:  

1. **Client (Browser)**  
   - Captures voice input with the MediaRecorder API  
   - Sends audio to the backend  
   - Plays the AI‚Äôs spoken response  
   - Updates UI states (ready, recording, thinking)  

2. **Server (FastAPI)**  
   - Receives audio input  
   - Sends audio ‚Üí **AssemblyAI** (STT)  
   - Retrieves chat history & sends context ‚Üí **Google Gemini** (LLM)  
   - Sends Gemini‚Äôs response ‚Üí **Murf AI** (TTS)  
   - Returns final audio URL to the client
